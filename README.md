# JavaFX_MediaPlayerDemo
This is a basic demo for the JavaFX MediaPlayer API. This program does the following:

- Loads song file and displays filename
- Plays, pauses, and restarts song via buttons
- Adjusts song position, volume, speed, and balance via sliders

This program was built on Eclipse Oxygen with e(fx)clipse installed. The JavaFX stage was formatted using JavaFX Scene Builder. These additions can be downloaded at the following links:
